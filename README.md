# Experiments

This repo is my personal sandbox. Contains scripts I used to experiment or test various technology platforms, algorythms, libraries, etc.

Examples:
- Azure Machine Learning service 
- Azure Cognitive services
- Hugging Face models and RL course
- Facebook Prophet forecasting library
- OpenAI GPT
- More to be added...

Some of the code originally came from vendor demos, vendor courses, or other public sources, and I just made modifications for the purpose of kicking the tires, lookin under the hood, etc. Some of the code I wrote from scratch. I usually reference the source, in case someone reading this wants to access the original unadultered content.  


 No guarantees, this is not a complete product, not even a product.
